  <h1>Hi there, I'm Catt!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a third-year IT student at UTS, majoring in Enterprise Systems Development with Data Analytics as a submajor. Despite being in my third year I'm still unsure about the direction I want to go, so I'm trying to explore different fields in order to have a better idea of what my options are like. That's the main reason why I've enrolled in 41152 Summer Studio C, specifically in <em>Studio 3: IoT Product Development from a Data Perspective</em> - to have a go at IoT development and see what it's like.

    I must admit that while I enjoy using code as a tool for problem solving, I have next to zero experience with the hardware side of things, so this will be an interesting learning experience :)

  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
  <p>I was given a bunch of succulent cuttings some time ago, but unfortunately I did not know how to care for them, so by this point in time only a few of them are still alive. I would love to have small pots of succulents scattered around at home though. I have started by looking up how to care for the succulents I currently have, and trying to propagate them, but it would be nice to have <em>a system of devices that can monitor each pot's condition and notify me when it needs to be watered or moved indoors/outdoors depending on its temperature/light needs.</em></p>
