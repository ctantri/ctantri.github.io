  <h1>Hi there, I'm Catt!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a third-year IT student at UTS, majoring in Enterprise Systems Development with Data Analytics as a submajor. Despite being in my third year I'm still unsure about the direction I want to go, so I'm trying to explore different fields in order to have a better idea of what my options are like. That's the main reason why I've enrolled in 41152 Summer Studio C, specifically in <em>Studio 3: IoT Product Development from a Data Perspective</em> - to have a go at IoT development and see what it's like.

    I must admit that while I enjoy using code as a tool for problem solving, I have next to zero experience with the hardware side of things, so this will be interesting learning experience :)
